Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm And your cheeks so soft, There is nothing for me but to love you, And the way you look tonight. With each word your tenderness grows, Tearing my fear apart, And that laugh that wrinkles your nose, It touches my foolish heart. Lovely, Never, ever change. Keep that breathless charm. Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you, Just the way you look tonight. Just the way you look to-night.",

Strangers in the night, two lonely people We were strangers in the night Up to the moment When we said our first hello. Little did we know Love was just a glance away, A warm embracing dance away and -  Ever since that night we've been together. Lovers at first sight, in love forever. It turned out so right, For strangers in the night.  Love was just a glance away, A warm embracing dance away -  Ever since that night we've been together. Lovers at first sight, in love forever.

I've traveled each and ev'ry highway; But more, much more than this, I did it my way.  Regrets, I've had a few; But then again, too few to mention. I did what I had to do And saw it through without exemption. I planned each charted course; Each careful step along the byway, But more, much more than this, I did it my way.  Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew When I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all, when there was doubt, I ate it up and spit it out. I faced it all and I stood tall; And did it my way.  I've loved, I've laughed and cried. I've had my fill; my share of losing. And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing. To think I did all that; And may I say - not in a shy way, \"No, oh no not me, I did it my way\".  For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has naught. To say the things he truly feels; And not the words of one who kneels. The record shows I took the blows - And did it my way!  Yes it was my way.",
